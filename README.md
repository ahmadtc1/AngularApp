# APM

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files, or just `ng s -o` to automatically run the app on the server, as well as open it in a browser.

## Purpose
This Angular project acted as an introduction for me towards creating web applications using the **Angular** framework, incorporating things such as both **one-way and two-way data binding**, **HTTP requests**, **routing**, **interfaces**, and even **custom pipes**.
